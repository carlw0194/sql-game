Great concept! To make SQL Scenario(name of my game) a fully-fledged game and the go-to learning app for SQL professionals, letâ€™s break it down into essential game mechanics, features, and requirements.

ðŸ”¹ Core Game Mechanics
Character Progression & Avatars

Players choose/customize avatars (DBA, Developer, Data Analyst, etc.).
Gain experience (XP), ranks, and skills as they progress.
Unlock advanced DBA titles (e.g., Junior DBA â†’ Senior DBA â†’ Database Architect).
Scenario-Based Challenges

Real-World SQL Problems: Based on enterprise-grade databases.
3 Types of Challenges:
Query Writing â€“ Write correct SQL queries based on prompts.
Performance Optimization â€“ Refactor slow queries for better efficiency.
Best Practices â€“ Identify and fix bad schema design, security flaws, and indexing issues.
Level Progression (500+ Levels)

Beginner (Levels 1-100) â€“ Basic joins, subqueries, indexing, transactions.
Intermediate (Levels 101-300) â€“ Optimization techniques, stored procedures, triggers.
Advanced (Levels 301-500) â€“ Query tuning, replication, sharding, backup strategies.
Expert (500+) â€“ Enterprise challenges: scaling, high availability, disaster recovery.
Hint System & SQL Documentation

If players struggle, they can:
Use hints (limited per challenge).
Access in-game SQL Docs for reference.
