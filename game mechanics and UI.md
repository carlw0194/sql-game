2. Target Audience
Intermediate to Advanced SQL Developers, DBAs, and Data Analysts.
Tech professionals wanting to upgrade or refresh SQL skills.
University students transitioning from theoretical learning to real-world scenarios.
3. Core Gameplay Mechanics
Scenario-Based Challenges

Each level presents a story-driven scenario (e.g., “Your database is experiencing deadlocks. Fix it!”).
The player must write queries, optimize existing code, or apply best practices to solve it.
SQL Code Editor

Integrated, interactive SQL editor with real-time feedback.
Query Execution & Validation in a sandboxed environment.
Hints or auto-completion available (limited or earned).
Avatar Progression

Choose or customize a DBA/dev avatar.
Level up your avatar’s skills and rank (e.g., Junior → Senior DBA).
Gain XP and unlock advanced challenges as you progress.
Scoring & Rewards

Earn points for correct answers, optimization wins, and best-practice adherence.
Collect badges and trophies (e.g., Indexing Guru, Query Tuner).
Leaderboards for global and friends-only rankings.
Boss Fights & Timed Challenges

Boss Fights: multi-step problems that combine query writing, tuning, and design fixes.
Time-Attack Mode: solve within a strict timeframe for higher rewards.
Multiplayer (Optional)

SQL Duels: race against another player to solve the same query challenge.
Team Quests: co-op tasks requiring collaboration on large data sets or enterprise-grade issues.
4. Game Progression & Level Structure
Levels 1–100 (Foundations):
Core SQL queries, joins, transaction basics, simple indexing.
Levels 101–300 (Intermediate):
Advanced joins (CTEs, window functions), query optimization, data modeling.
Levels 301–500 (Advanced):
Complex indexing, partitioning, concurrency, troubleshooting, replication.
Post-500 (Expert/Endgame):
Real enterprise scenarios: large-scale data warehousing, disaster recovery, sharding, security audits.
